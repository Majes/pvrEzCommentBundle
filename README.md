# pvrEzCommentBundle

The ```pvrEzCommentBundle``` adds support for comments for ezpublish 5. This is an evolution from original extension
eZComments available on legacy stack.

Important note: the master of this repository is containing current development in order to work with eZ Publish 2013.6.
If you are using old version of eZ Publish, this will probably not work and will be not supported too.
